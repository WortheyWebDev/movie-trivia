# Movie Trivia Game

## Description
A 10-question movie trivia game. The application reacts to a user's answers, flagging them as correct or incorrect before moving to the next question. Users have the option to restart the quiz at any time. When the quiz is complete, users are presented with their final score.

## Features
- **Multiple Choice Questions:** Users are presented with four potential answers for each question.
- **Answer Feedback:** Answers provide feedback through styling when clicked: correct answers turn green, wrong answers turn red.
- **Restart:** Users can start the quiz from the beginning by clicking the "Restart" button.
- **Thematic Visuals and Animations:** The page is designed to evoke the feeling of seeing a movie, from the art deco design to the animated film grain on the screen.
